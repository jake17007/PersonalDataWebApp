        Connectrix is a platform for secure personal data analytics. We aggregate your personal data from sources like Fitbit, Moves, or YouTube and run it through analytics apps for you to gain insight. Since this takes place on our servers, Connectrix app developers never see your data, but you can still benefit from a wide variety of analytics apps.
